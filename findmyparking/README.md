# Find My Parking

Agile Software Development Project with Elixir, Pheonix and Vue.

### To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Seed your database with `mix ecto.seed`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Testing:

  * Run white bread BDD tests with `mix white_bread.run`
